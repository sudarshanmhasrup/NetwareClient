### About the project directory structure.
I have divided this project into sub-modules so it will be easy  going through the source code of this project for anyone who's willing to go through the proejct source code. I have also added API module and make sure you run it first before starting your walkthrough.
- `/api`: This module contains API logic.
- `/gradle`: Contains gradle metadata.
- `/java`: This contains a sample of NetwareClient usages in Java.
- `/kotlin`: This module contains a sample of NetwareClient usages in Kotlin.
- `/library`: This is the main module of this project and contains library logic.
